INTRODUCTION

A software developer's portfolio is something some people find important and others don't even look at. I think a project porfolio demonstrating your front end skills is always good, however I think what is most important is how a developer works in the professional world.
This starts with receiving the design idea and creating tasks and continues until the user is 100% satisfied with us product and its support. 
The idea for this portfolio project is to showcase how I work and the quality of work I can do under time constraints.

CUSTOMERS

People looking at my profile could be anyone from the public. Developers looking for ideas, hiring managers looking for their star developer.
